TODO
- Use BCP-47 naming scheme for fpdf.conf, and drop name vs language tag, and just use tag
- Better Makefile
- Improve error handling and reporting.
- Split off table and heap routines to separate source files.
- Speed optimizations. Some speed might be gained by comparing
  the unknown fingerprint to all known fingerprints at once.
- More docs, more comments.
- Make a language model for Klingon.
